## My process

Create Github repository
- initialize README

Setup basic HTML file 
- insert my personal comment credit
- head tag includes stylesheet/link and fonts, double check for meta viewport tag
- initial semantic, accessible markup: placing main, heading and paragraph tags
 - commit and push

Setup basic CSS file
- insert my personal comment credit
- decide on mobile or desktop-first design based on design file examples
- set up root selector with variables: colors, border radius, and font size
- margin, padding, box-size reset, root
- decide on global styles
- commit and push

Consult Figma design files
 - use rems or ems
 - adjust text properties: size, line height, color
 - insert images and color properties
 - decide on layout tools and markup accordingly
 - add effects: borders, box shadows, etc
 - commit and push after each major change

Publish live URL

Check markup and accessibility
(https://validator.w3.org/)
(https://wave.webaim.org/)
 - make adjustments as necessary
 - commit and push
 - finish README


### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Responsive Web Design

### What I learned

I'm excited to get back into JS and continue to learn how HTML, CSS, and JS work together.


```javascript

countEl.innerText = count
//vs.
countEl.textContent = count

//textContent isn't parsed as HTML

```

### Continued development
